# Password Cracker 

This project aims to use the tools Hydra and Hashcat to simulate a password cracking attack 

## HYDRA ON SSH

## STEP 1: SETUP UP 2 UBUNTU VMs

### SERVER 1 (Attacker)

Install Hydra: `sudo apt update` `sudo apt install hydra -y`

Install Nmap: `sudo apt install nmap -y`

### SERVER 2 (Target)

Install SSH: `sudo apt update` `sudo apt install openssh-server -y`

## STEP 2: CREATE TEST USER WITH WEAK PASSWORD (In Target)

Command used: `sudo  adduser adminuser`
** Password was set to: password123 **

## STEP 3: START SSH SERVER

Command used: `sudo systemctl start ssh` 

## STEP 4: FIND TARGET VM'S IP ADDRESS (In Attacker)

Find subnet of VM: `ip a`
The  subnet was 192.168.56.101/24

Scan subnet with Nmap: `nmap -sn 192.168.56.102/24  `

Scan IPs for open ports: `nmap -p 22 --open `
 
## STEP 5: CREATE A WORDLIST FILE

Command used: `touch password.txt`

The file contained a list of possible passwords

## STEP 6: LAUNCH HYDRA ATTACK

Command used: `hydra -l adminuser -P password.txt ssh://`
